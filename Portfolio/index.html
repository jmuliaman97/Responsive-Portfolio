  <div class="h4" style="margin-top: 12px;">History</div>
  <p class="lead">
    I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia and Perth, Western Australia. I moved to Seattle, Washington for college and later on I transferred to UC Irvine where I got my BA degree in Psychology back in 2016. I've been working as a Behavior Interventionist ever since but now I've decided that I want to do something different and this is why I took the bootcamp.

  <div class="h4">Hobbies</div>
  <p class="lead">
    I enjoy playing sports and listen to music. I play ice hockey and basketball regularly and I like watching sports. My favorite teams are the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners, LA Lakers and LA Kings. I like listening to music. I listen to all kinds of music but I particularly enjoy listening to EDM. I go to music festival occasionally and I play the guitar and drum.
  </p>

  <div class="h4">Goals</div>
  <p class="lead">
    I'm taking this course because I'm looking for a career change. I want to be able to work from home and my future goal is to freelance when I've mastered all the necessary skills. I believe that the job outlook for web developer will be great in the future and it's very interesting to have a new skill that can be beneficial.
