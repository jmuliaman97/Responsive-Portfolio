For this project I did almost everything using Bootstrap in order to make the page responsive and the website gave us useful tools to make the portfolio. For each page I made sure that there's a navbar, main body and footer and I also changed the background for each page. So the navbar and footer I used Bootstrap and for the navbar logo I had my brother design the logo since he's a graphic designer, 
For the main page I've included a picture of myself, my name and my profession. For the portfolio page I searched up some past materials from the prework and I listed all the prework using cards and I include the link to the prework as well. For contacts I used table and forms. In order for the page to be responsive I used grid especially for the portfolio and contacts page. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the result but I feel that I can still improve on the portfolio in the future.
